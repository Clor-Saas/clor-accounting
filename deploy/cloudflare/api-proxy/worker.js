/**
 * api.clor.in -> Cloud Run (asia-south1).
 *
 * Cloud Run domain mapping is not available in asia-south1, and a Google load
 * balancer costs more than the database. This Worker keeps api.clor.in on
 * Cloudflare (same site as app.clor.in, so the HttpOnly refresh cookie stays
 * first-party) and forwards every request to the service's run.app address.
 *
 * X-Forwarded-For is OVERWRITTEN with Cloudflare's verified client IP. The API's
 * rate limiter keys on the first X-Forwarded-For entry, so a client-supplied
 * value must never reach it through this path.
