/**
 * The apps Clor sells. The commercial twin of the shell's registry: the shell
 * decides what to render, this decides what may be bought and billed.
 *
 * Pricing is deliberately NOT here. What a plan costs and how it is metered
 * (free / per-seat / per-app / flat) is a decision that is not yet made, and it
 * belongs on the subscription item when it is, not hard-coded into the catalog.
 * This file answers only "which apps exist and can be subscribed to".
